  As an estimator I want to be able to
  call Est as a command line tool

  Scenario: Help can be printed
    When I run bin/est with "-h"
    Then Exit code is zero
    And Stdout contains "-v, --verbose"

  Scenario: Version can be printed
    When I run bin/est with "--version"
    Then Exit code is zero

  Scenario: Simple estimate calculating, in XML
    Given I have a "sample.est" file with content:
